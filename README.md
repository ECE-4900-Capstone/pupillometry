# pupillometry - Jetson Video Recording

These scripts were ran on the Nvidia Jetson to record video from the cameras.

I'm pretty sure "takeVideoThreaded_fpsCount" was the final version with FPS count and time stored in the corner of each frame, with each frame in black and white, but I have included the other files as they each may have some different features. 
Recording is started by pressing the "space" key, and stopped by pressing the "q" key.
